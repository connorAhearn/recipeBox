> ## RecipeBox
> The intent of this application is to become a grocery list building application using online recipes provided through urls.
> 
> The current target is to return the ingredients of a recipe if you provide my webapp the URL to a recipe you enjoy. At the moment this is leveraging the Spoonacular API. I have plans for future iterations to remove this dependency as well as some other big ideas!
> 
> Since I've never been able to ride out a large scale personal project to the end, I'm trying a new approach with this one. I'm trying to start a habit with small commits & contributions every day in hopes that I stick this one through!
> 
> Stay tuned for more!
